## Assessment Overview

### Task 1 — Database Schema  
Designed three relational tables: `leads`, `applications`, and `tasks` with proper constraints, foreign keys, and performance-focused indexes for common queries.

### Task 2 — Row Level Security (RLS)  
Implemented multi-tenant access control using Supabase RLS. Counselors can access their own leads or team leads, while admins can access all tenant leads.

### Task 3 — Edge Function (create-task)  
Built a secure Supabase Edge Function to validate input, create tasks using a service role key, and return proper API responses with structured error handling.

### Task 4 — Frontend Dashboard  
Built a Next.js dashboard page to fetch tasks due today, exclude completed ones, display them in a table, and allow real-time status updates using Supabase.

### Task 5 — Stripe Checkout (Design)  
Designed a secure Stripe Checkout payment flow using backend session creation, database tracking, and webhook verification.

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd LearnLynk-Submission

### 2. Setup Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
Create a .env.local file inside frontend:

### 3. env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

### 4. Start the frontend:
npm run dev
Visit:http://localhost:3000/dashboard/today

---

### Setup Supabase Backend

- Run schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
- Run rls_policies.sql after schema
- Deploy the Edge Function create-task via Supabase Dashboard or CLI
- Set environment variables:
    - SUPABASE_URL
    - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

---

### Testing

Insert dummy data using SQL

Test the Edge Function using Supabase Invoke or Postman

Mark tasks complete from the frontend

## Stripe Answer

When a user clicks “Pay Application Fee” on the frontend, the `application_id` is sent to the backend. The backend first creates a `payment_requests` row with status set to `pending` before calling Stripe. A Stripe Checkout Session is then created with the fee amount and metadata such as `application_id` and `payment_request_id`. The returned Stripe `session_id` is stored back in the `payment_requests` table. The frontend is redirected to the Stripe Checkout URL for secure payment. After payment, Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` webhook to the backend. The webhook signature is verified for authenticity. On successful verification, the `payment_requests` status is updated to `paid`, and the corresponding application is marked as `payment_completed`. This ensures payment confirmation is handled securely on the server and prevents fake success from the frontend.
